        About Us: Dream Bigger At Dream Bigger, we believe every young person
        deserves the opportunity to rise above adversity and pursue their full
        potential. We are a youth-centered initiative dedicated to empowering
        the next generation through mentorship, education, creative expression,
        and access to real-world opportunities. Founded with the goal of
        breaking cycles of poverty, incarceration, and systemic inequality,
        Dream Bigger creates safe, inclusive spaces where youth can develop
        confidence, discover their purpose, and take actionable steps toward
        achieving their dreams. We serve justice-impacted, underrepresented, and
        underserved youth particularly those who have faced barriers related to
        trauma, community violence, lack of resources, or generational hardship.
        Through culturally rooted programming, leadership development, and
        community collaboration, Dream Bigger offers a holistic support system
        designed to elevate youth and encourage lifelong success. Our VisionTo
        inspire a world where every young personâ€”regardless of their past or
        circumstances has the tools, support, and belief to dream bigger, live
        purposefully, and lead change in their communities.
